# CPSC-122

All my classwork from my 2nd semester in college. It showcases how I translated the ideas of object-oriented-programming that I got from coding in lua to C++.
Some interesting PA's to take a look at include PA2 which analyzes the effiency of different sort programs, and PA5 which shows my knowledge of classes and structs.

This is NOT meant to be copied by other students. This is to showcase my C++ skills and my rapid growth to those interested in seeing it.
