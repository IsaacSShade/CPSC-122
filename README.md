# CPSC-122

All my classwork from my 2nd semester in college. It showcases how I translated the ideas of object-oriented-programming that I got from coding in lua to C++.
Some interesting PA's to take a look at include PA2 which analyzes the effiency of different sort programs, and PA5 which shows my knowledge of classes and structs.

This is NOT meant to be copied by other students. This is to showcase my C++ skills and my rapid growth to those interested in seeing it.
##
**PA1** - Converts english to morse or morse to english depending on the input provided by the user.<br>
**PA2** - Creating and testing the efficiency of various sorting alogrithms that we learned about in class. Graphs are attached in the folder that display the findings.<br>
**PA3** - Various random functions working with introducing dynamic memory and pointers to the class.<br>
**PA4** - Finds the frequency of a specific character in the input the user gives and creates a histogram with the frequency it found for alphabet-type characters.<br>
**PA5** - A UI in the terminal for managing a song library. You can add, remove, sort, find, edit, load, save, and display songs in a library.<br>
