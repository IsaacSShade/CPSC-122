# CPSC-122

All my classwork from my 2nd semester in college. It showcases how I translated the ideas of object-oriented-programming that I got from coding in lua to C++.
Some interesting PA's to take a look at include PA2 which analyzes the effiency of different sort programs, and PA5 which shows my knowledge of classes and structs.
